# NIFF

Code for our work [As large as it gets â€“ Studying Infinitely Large Convolutions via Neural Implicit Frequency Filters](https://openreview.net/forum?id=xRy1YRcHWj).
We include several CNN architectures incorporating our Neural Implicit Frequency Filters (NIFF) and the code of our NIFF.

Network structures are taken from  https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/main/torchvision/models and https://github.com/facebookresearch/ConvNeXt.

The training script can be found at https://github.com/facebookresearch/ConvNeXt.
